# Learn Terraform data sources | VPC repository

I forked this repo in order to complete [this tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/data-sources?in=terraform/certification-associate-tutorials) which is part of the [Terraform Associate Tutorial List](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/certification-associate-tutorials).

---

## Objective

I created this branch in an effort to make the tutorial completely free to do in AWS, as the original one creates private subnets that are behind NAT gateways. These gateways aren't free and they aren't necessary for the purpose of the tutorial itself.

## Changes made

- Removed the private subnet blocks
- Disabled the NAT gateways in the VPC module
